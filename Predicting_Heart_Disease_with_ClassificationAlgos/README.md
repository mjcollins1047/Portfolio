# Prediction Heart Disease with Classification Algorithms

Heart disease contributed to over 600k deaths in 2020 or 1 person passes every 36 seconds from heart disease. As insurance providers continue to look for avenues to reduce costs, hospitals are undertaking programs to improve patient outcomes, reduce spending, and avoid penalties from insurance providers, early intervention to prevent disease progression is critical. The research created new classification algorithms using data from the Cleveland Heart Disease Center to enhance knowledge on earlier prognosis for the prevention of this devastating disease.

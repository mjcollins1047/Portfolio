Data Science Portfolio
Hello my name is Matthew Collins.  I am a recent graduate of Bellevue University's Master of Data Science program.  
While a graduate of teh program my passion for the last 25 years have been as a qualiy professional in the medical device and pharmaceuical industries.
I became interested in data science because of my constant dealing with regulatory authorities around the world's expansive use of data sceince.  

I find it essential to stay with the evolution of insight and analysis.  Customer sentiment, and critical information is rapid, evolving and traced to many disparate locations.
Whether it is facebook, ebay, amazon, twitter, instagram or other, people are being heard.  Being able to bring this together can ensure we continue to bring the best products, 
and best oucome to patients by hearing all their voices.  The sentiment of doing well by doing good, only resonates through the act of listenting.  

The Food and Drug Administration continues to evolve their data science program.  As a responsible manufacturer, why do I need the FDA to monitor and outline when I may or may not
have a problem.  My job is to be proactive, and responsbile.  By the time the FDA is alerted to a signal it may be too late.  Part of doing well by doing good, means assuming the
responsibility and not relying on external entitites.

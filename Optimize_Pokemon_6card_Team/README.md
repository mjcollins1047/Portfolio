I enjoy killing time with games. Being an avid gamer, I wanted to evaluate information that can be used to help me gain competitive insight. I am normally evaluating World of Warcraft (WOW). However, I decided to take on a new series of gaming data. The Pokemon series, while this is an old game, it consumed many wasted hours. With some of the new skills, I have been developing, I wanted to understand how I could have gained a competitive advantage back in my Pokemon days. What would my dream team of 6 Pokemon looks like? How could I maximize my offense and defense to dominate my opponents? My objective is to do the following:

Identify the most powerful characters.
More legendary Pokemon in certain generations?
Set up a card defense that is optimized based on the 6 optimal characters.

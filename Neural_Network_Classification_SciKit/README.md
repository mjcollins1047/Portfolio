Neural networks are set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of human brian. Generally when you open your eyes, what you see is called data and is processed by the Nuerons(data processing cells) in your brain, and recognises what is around you. Thatâ€™s how similar the Neural Networks works. They takes a large set of data, process the data(draws out the patterns from data), and outputs what it is.  Let's explore how to create a Neural Network!
